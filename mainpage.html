<p style="font-size:25px">Al or artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines , especially computer systems .<br>These processes include learning , reasoning and self correction . Some of the applications of Al include expert systems , speech recognition and machine vision .<br>Artificial Intelligence is advancing dramatically It is already transforming our world socially , economically and politically . Al was coined by John McCarthy , an American computer scientist , in 1956 at The Dartmouth Conference where the discipline was born .<br>Today , it is an umbrella term that encompasses everything from robotic process automation to actual robotics . Al can perform tasks such as identifying patterns in the data more efficiently than humans , enabling businesses to gain more insight out of their data .<br>With the help from Al , massive amounts of data can be analyzed to map poverty and climate change , automate agricultural practices and irrigation , individualize healthcare and learning , predict consumption patterns , streamline energy usage and waste - management .</p>
