<p style="font-size:25px">The final goal of artificial intelligence (AI)—that a machine can have a type of general intelligence similar to a human’s—is one of the most ambitious ever proposed by science. In terms of difficulty, it is comparable to other great scientific goals, such as explaining the origin of life or the Universe, or discovering the structure of matter.<br>In recent centuries, this interest in building intelligent machines has led to the invention of models or metaphors of the human brain. In the seventeenth century, for example, Descartes wondered whether a complex mechanical system of gears, pulleys, and tubes could possibly emulate thought.<br>Two centuries later, the metaphor had become telephone systems, as it seemed possible that their connections could be likened to a neural network. Today, the dominant model is computational and is based on the digital computer.<br>Therefore, that is the model we will address in the present article.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">According to Searle, weak AI would involve constructing programs to carry out specific tasks, obviously without need for states of mind. Computers’ capacity to carry out specific tasks, sometimes even better than humans, has been amply demonstrated. In certain areas, weak AI has become so advanced that it far outstrips human skill.<br>Examples include solving logical formulas with many variables, playing chess or Go, medical diagnosis, and many others relating to decision-making. Weak AI is also associated with the formulation and testing of hypotheses about aspects of the mind (for example, the capacity for deductive reasoning, inductive learning, and so on) through the construction of programs that carry out those functions, even when they do so using processes totally unlike those of the human brain.<br>As of today, absolutely all advances in the field of AI are manifestations of weak and specific AI.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">Hedge funds are using AI to beat the stock market, Google is utilizing it to diagnose heart disease more quickly and accurately, and American Express is deploying AI bots to serve its customers online. Researchers no longer speak of just one AI, but of hundreds, each specializing in a complex task—and many of the applications are already lapping the humans that made them.
In just the last few years, “machine learning” has come to seem like the new path forward. Algorithms, freed from human programmers, are training themselves on massive data sets and producing results that have shocked even the optimists in the field.<br>Earlier this year, two AIs—one created by the Chinese company Alibaba and the other by Microsoft—beat a team of two-legged competitors in a Stanford reading-comprehension test. The algorithms “read” a series of Wikipedia entries on things like the rise of Genghis Khan and the Apollo space program and then answered a series of questions about them more accurately than people did.<br>One Alibaba scientist declared the victory a “milestone.”</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">These so-called “narrow” AIs are everywhere, embedded in your GPS systems and Amazon recommendations. But the ultimate goal is artificial general intelligence, a self-teaching system that can outperform humans across a wide range of disciplines. Some scientists believe it’s 30 years away; others talk about centuries. This AI “takeoff,” also known as the singularity, will likely see AI pull even with human intelligence and then blow past it in a matter of days. Or hours.

Once it arrives, general AI will begin taking jobs away from people, millions of jobs—as drivers, radiologists, insurance adjusters. In one possible scenario, this will lead governments to pay unemployed citizens a universal basic income, freeing them to pursue their dreams unburdened by the need to earn a living. In another, it will create staggering wealth inequalities, chaos and failed states across the globe. But the revolution will go much further. AI robots will care for the elderly—scientists at Brown University are working with Hasbro to develop a “robo-cat” that can remind its owners to take their meds and can track down their eyeglasses. AI “scientists” will solve the puzzle of dark matter; AI-enabled spacecraft will reach the asteroid belts, while on Earth the technology will tame climate change, perhaps by sending massive swarms of drones to reflect sunlight away from the oceans.

“AIs will colonize and transform the entire cosmos,” says Juergen Schmidhuber, a pioneering computer scientist based at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Switzerland, “and they will make it intelligent.”</p>
