<p style="font-size:25px">Everything in excess is dangerous and so is the case with Artificial Intelligence.
It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, that makes it significant.
With the simulation of human intelligence, processes by machines that are especially computer systems include learning the acquisition of information and rules for using it.<br>
The reasoning uses rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions and self-correction.</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">There is no doubt in saying that technology is an essential part of the development and growth of humans.<br>
A thin line or mistake leads to disruption or destruction.</p>


<h3 style="font-size:30px"> - Advantages Of AI </h3>
                                                          <ul>
														      <li style="font-size:30px">Less Room for Errors</li>
														  </ul>
														      <p style="font-size:25px">As decisions taken by a machine are based on previous records of data and the set of algorithms, the chances of errors reduce. This is an achievement, as solving complex problems that require difficult calculation,<br> can be done without any scope of error.
														      Have you heard of digital assistants? Advanced business organizations use digital assistants to interact with users, something that helps save them time. This helps businesses fulfil user demands without keeping them waiting.<br>
														      They are programmed to give the best possible assistance to a user.</p>
														  <ul>
														      <li style="font-size:30px">Right Decision Making</li>
														  </ul>
														      <p style="font-size:25px">The complete absence of emotions from a machine makes it more efficient as they are able to take the right decisions in a short span of time. The best example of this is its usage in healthcare.<br>The integration of Al tools in the healthcare sector has improved the efficiency of treatments by minimizing the risk of false diagnosis.</p>
														  <ul>
                                                             <li style="font-size:30px">Implementing AI in Risky Situations</li>
                                                          </ul>
                                                              <p style="font-size:25px">Certain situations where human safety is vulnerable, machines that are fitted with predefined algorithms can be used. Nowadays, scientists are making use of complex machines to study the ocean floor where human survival becomes difficult.<br>This is one of the biggest limitations that AI helps to overcome.</p>
                                                          <ul>
                                                          	 <li style="font-size:30px">Can Work Continuously</li>
                                                          </ul>
                                                              <p style="font-size:25px">Unlike humans, machine does not get tired, even if it has to work for consecutive hours. This is a major benefit over the humans, who need rest time to time to be efficient.<br>However, in the case of machines, their efficiency is not affected by any external factor and it does not get in the way of continuous work.

                                                          </ul>
                                                              <p style="font-size:25px">When combining the cost of installation, maintenance and repair, Al is an expensive proposition.<br>Those of who have huge funds can implement it.<br>However, businesses and industries that do not have funds will find it difficult to implement Al technology into their processes or strategies.</p>
                                                          <ul>
                                                             <li style="font-size:30px">Dependency on Machines</li>

                                                              <p style="font-size:25px">With the dependency of humans on machines increasing, we're headed into a time where it becomes difficult for humans to work without the assistance of a machine. We've seen it in the past and there's no doubt we'll continue seeing it in the future, our dependency on machines will only increase. As a result, mental and thinking abilities of humans will actually decrease over time.</p>
                                                          <ul>
                                                             <li style="font-size:30px">Displace Low Skilled Jobs</li>
                                                          </ul>
                                                              <p style="font-size:25px">This is the primary concern for technocrats so far. It is quite possible that Al will displace many low skilled jobs. As machines can work 24*7 with no break, industries prefer investing in machines as compared to humans.<br>As we are moving towards the automated world, where almost every task will be done by the a possibility of large-scale unemployment.<br>A real-time example of this is the concept of driverless cars. If the concept of driverless machines, there is cars kicks in, millions of drivers will be left unemployed in the future.</p>

														  </ul>
														      <p style="font-size:25px">Al machines are programmed to do certain tasks based on what they are trained and programmed to do. Relying on machines to adapt to new environments, be creative and think out of the box will be a big mistake.<br>This is not possible because their thinking zone is restricted to only the algorithms that they have been trained for.</p>
