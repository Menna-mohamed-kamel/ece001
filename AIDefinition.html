<p style="font-size:25px">Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents" .
Any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as "a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data,
and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (Al) is progressing rapidly.
While science fiction often portrays Al as robots with human-like characteristics, Al can encompass anything from Google's search algorithms to IBM's Watson to autonomous weapons.
Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow Al (or weak Al), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car).
However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general Al (AGI or strong Al). While narrow Al may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.

As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.</p>
